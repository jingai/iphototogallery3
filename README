iPhotoToGallery3 plugin allows you to upload your iPhoto photos to a Gallery 3 site.

You can download it from the Download section.

To install it, you need to :

1) decompress the zip file
2) stop iPhoto
3) copy the "iPhotoToGallery3.iPhotoExporter" folder to the "~/Library/Application Support/iPhoto/Plugins" folder. If this folder doesn't exist then create it.
4) start iPhoto
5) Activate the REST module in your Gallery server via the administration pages.


That's it. Enjoy !
