iPhotoToGallery3 plugin allows you to upload your iPhoto photos to a Gallery 3 site.

You can download it from the Download section.

To install it, you need to :

0) check that your gallery3 server php.ini memory_limit is at 32MB at least (see http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery3:Requirements)
1) decompress the zip file
2) stop iPhoto
3) copy the "iPhotoToGallery3.iPhotoExporter" folder to the "~/Library/Application Support/iPhoto/Plugins" folder. If this folder doesn't exist then create it.
4) start iPhoto
5) Activate the REST module in your Gallery server via the administration pages.

Usage :

When entering the Gallery URL be carefull to add "index.php/" if needed (depending on your .htaccess rewrite url params)
ie : http://myhost/gallery3/index.php/
or 
ie : http://myhost/gallery3/

 

That's it. Enjoy !
